# LeatherColor
Color your leather armor (or Horse Armor) with one Command!

## Usage
just put it in the plugins Directory and it should work (**1.13+!**)
then hold a leatherarmor piece in your **main**-hand and use the command /color <color>
Example: /color #7fff00
(the # is mandatory and cannot be left out (maybe I will do that in a later release.)
